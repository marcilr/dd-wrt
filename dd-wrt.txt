DD-WRT is a Linux based alternative OpenSource firmware suitable
for a great variety of WLAN routers and embedded systems.  The
main emphasis lies on providing the easiest possible handling
while at the same time supporting a great number of functionalities
within the framework of the respective hardware platform used.

Where Does the Name DD-WRT Come From?
=====================================
DD-WRT branched off Sveasoft's work once they began to start charging
for their firmware, releasing its first version in early 2005.  Part of
the name of that initial router, the WRT (Wireless Receiver/Transmitter)
was merged with DD, the German automobile license plate code for Dresden,
home of the project's founder BrainSlayer. 

The project was successful enough that DD-WRT has become the basis for
other firmware created by router manufacturers themselves.
