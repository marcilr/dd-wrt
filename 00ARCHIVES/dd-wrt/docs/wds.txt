WDS Linked router network
=========================
WDS (Wireless Distribution Service) creates a wireless backbone link 
between multiple access points that are part of the same wireless 
network. This allows a wireless network to be expanded using 
multiple access points without the need for a wired backbone to link 
them, as is traditionally required. The WDS-enabled access points 
can accept wireless clients (e.g. wireless laptop users) just as 
traditional APs would. There is no free lunch, however: WDS consumes 
wireless bandwidth normally available to wireless clients.

In regards to integration with DD-WRT, it is confirmed working with 
WEP and WPA enabled. However, WPA2 is not supported. 


Setup
-----
1. Save the configuration on both routers: Administration -> Backup. 
Click "Backup" button and follow prompts so save nvram backup files, 
i.e. nvram_host.bin, and nvram_client.bin. The configurations can be 
restored if the setup doesn't work out and you need to quickly get 
back to a different (working) configuration. 

Checking wrt54gl-ug.pdf manual, page 34, backup is under
Administration -> Config Management -> "Backup" button.
Backed up configs under backup/cfg directory.

2. Reset both routers to factory default settings so other settings 
will not have a possible conflict: Administration -> Factory Default - 
select yes - click "Save Settings" button.

3. Give both the routers a different IP address, i.e. 192.168.1.1 
(host/internet gateway) and 192.168.1.2 ("client router") on the same 
subnet. Setup -> Basic Setup

4. Change the Internet Connection Type to Disable on the client 
router. Setup -> Basic Setup -> Internet Setup -> Internet Connection 
Type -> Disable

5. Set the Gateway IP address of the client router to the LAN IP 
address of the host router. Setup -> Basic Setup -> Network Setup 
-> Router IP -> Gateway

6. For each router, under Setup -> Basic Setup -- Network Address 
Server Settings (DHCP) -- Start IP Address, you may want to set 
different starting address for the different routers. For example 
host 192.168.1.1 starts DHCP at 100 and client 192.168.1.2 starts at 
200. This will allow you to enable DHCP on both routers and know which 
router you are connecting to. This is helpful when connecting to your 
network with a wireless laptop so you know which router it is 
connecting to and for changing wireless power settings (both laptop 
and routers). Alternately, you can disable DHCP on the client
router(s) and have only the gateway perform DHCP services.

7. On the client router, under Setup -> Basic Setup -- Network 
Address Server Settings (DHCP) -- Static DNS 1,2,3 enter the DNS 
settings provided by your ISP. These can also be found from the 
host router under Status -> Router -- Internet.

8. Turn off the firewall on the client router. Security -> 
Firewall -> Firewall Protection -> Disable

9. Turn off security on both routers (this should already be done 
if you reset as above). Security can be re-enabled after all other 
steps are complete, but in order to minimize troubleshooting, it's 
best to get things setup with no security active. Wireless 
-> Wireless Security -> Security Mode -> Disabled

10. Put both routers into AP mode and on the same channel. 
Wireless -> Basic Settings

11. Under Wireless -> Basic Settings, set the SSID to your liking. 
For WPA WDS, the SSID for the routers needs to be the same. For 
WEP, different SSIDs can make troubleshooting easier. 

12. If you plan to use WPA later, then select G-only in Wireless 
-> Basic Settings. You cannot use B-only with WDS.

13. Open WDS configuration on both routers. Wireless -> WDS 

14. On each router, you will see its wireless MAC address at 
the top of the Wireless -> WDS page. Put each router's MAC 
into the table of the other router, and select LAN for the 
type. Note that this MAC address is different from the one 
that may be printed on your case!

15. There is no need to enable Lazy WDS or WDS subnet on 
either router.

16. Test that you can ping the gateway from the client. Note 
that it may take a short amount of time for the WDS to be 
established, and you may need to reboot both the gateway and 
the client.

17. Enable encryption now, if you like (highly recommended).
