Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server. It is designed 
to provide DNS and (optionally) DHCP to a small network.  It can serve the names of local 
machines which are not in the global DNS.  The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server 
and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured 
either in each host or in a central configuration file.  Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic 
DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.

DNSMasq Options
===============
Assuming your LAN domain is called 'lan', put the following lines in the 
"additional DNSMasq options" field: 

domain=lan
local=/lan/
expand-hosts


FIXME: Need to update above with correct web interface path.
