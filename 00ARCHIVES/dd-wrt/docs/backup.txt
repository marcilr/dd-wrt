FIXME: Not seeing backup under DD-WRT yet:)

Backup of router firmware using DD-WRT.

"Save the configuration on both routers: Administration -> Backup. 
Click "Backup" button and follow prompts so save nvram backup files, 
i.e. nvram_host.bin, and nvram_client.bin. The configurations can be 
restored if the setup doesn't work out and you need to quickly get 
back to a different (working) configuration."
