wozzle (computer room) - host/internet gateway
S/N: CL7A0F209508

IP: 192.168.1.1
MAC (after flash) 
  Status => Sys-Info
  LAN MAC:      00:16:B6:1C:7D:B8 
  WAN MAC:      00:16:B6:1C:7D:B9 
  Wireless MAC: 00:16:B6:1C:7D:BA  
 
MAC (before flash): 00:16:B6:1C:7D:B8


Configuration:
=============
1. Assume already at factory defaults.
2. Skipped - Assumed at factory default settings.
3. Skipped - IP address already 192.168.1.1
4. Skipped - client only.
5. Skipped - client only.
6. For each router, under Setup -> Basic Setup -- Network Address 
Server Settings (DHCP) -- Start IP Address, you may want to set 
different starting address for the different routers. For example 
host 192.168.1.1 starts DHCP at 100 and client 192.168.1.2 starts at 
200. This will allow you to enable DHCP on both routers and know which 
router you are connecting to. This is helpful when connecting to your 
network with a wireless laptop so you know which router it is 
connecting to and for changing wireless power settings (both laptop 
and routers). Alternately, you can disable DHCP on the client
router(s) and have only the gateway perform DHCP services.

Start IP Address set to 192.168.1.100

7. Skipped - client only. Do I need these since this box is 
providing DHCP to wireless clients?
8. Skipped - client only.
9. Turn off security on both routers (this should already be done 
if you reset as above). Security can be re-enabled after all other 
steps are complete, but in order to minimize troubleshooting, it's 
best to get things setup with no security active. 
Wireless -> Wireless Security -> Security Mode -> Disabled

Security mode disable by default.

10. Put both routers into AP mode and on the same channel. 
Wireless -> Basic Settings
  Wireless Mode:     AP             # Default setting
  Wireless Channel:  6 - 2.437Ghz   # Default setting

11. Under Wireless -> Basic Settings, set the SSID to your liking. 
For WPA WDS, the SSID for the routers needs to be the same. For 
WEP, different SSIDs can make troubleshooting easier. 

Planning on WDS so set to "rockhounding"

12. If you plan to use WPA later, then select G-only in 
Wireless -> Basic Settings. You cannot use B-only with WDS.

Set Wireless Network Mode to G-Only.

13. Open WDS configuration on both routers. Wireless -> WDS

14. On each router, you will see its wireless MAC address at 
the top of the Wireless -> WDS page. Put each router's MAC 
into the table of the other router, and select LAN for the 
type. Note that this MAC address is different from the one 
that may be printed on your case!

Added wizzle (garage) - client router
  Wireles MAC: 00:16:B6:1C:7D:BD

15. There is no need to enable Lazy WDS or WDS subnet on 
either router.

16. Test that you can ping the gateway from the client. Note 
that it may take a short amount of time for the WDS to be 
established, and you may need to reboot both the gateway and 
the client.

Works! See test files for ping results.

17. Enable encryption now, if you like (highly recommended).

Tried this (did not work):
Set Wireless -> Wireless Security
Security-Mode: Pre-Shared Key
WPA Algorithms: AES
WPA Shared Key: ****


Additional: 
==========
1. Setup -> Basic Setup - Did not set gateway since the
goal is a bridge. 
2. Setup -> Basic Setup - Connection Type?
Set to disable on client. Same for host/internet gateway.
