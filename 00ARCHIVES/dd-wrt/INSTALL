=============================
1. On wizzle, ip 192.168.1.1, under Administration > Firmware Upgrade > Browse...
selected 00TARBALLS/dd-wrt/v24-SP1-Stable-Build-10020/dd-wrt.v24_mini_generic.bin

2. At Sat Jul 30 18:37:55 AKDT 2011 - clicked Upgrade

3. At Sat Jul 30 18:39:13 AKDT 2011 - Unit rebooted and looks good.

4. At router menu now see firmware: DD-WRT v24-sp1 (07/27/08) mini.

At dd-rt control panel got: 

"Your Router is currently not protected and uses an unsafe default username 
and password combination, please change it using the following dialog:

Router Password
    Router Username: root 
    Router Password: admin
Re-enter to confirm: admin

click Change Password

Got right back to dd-wrt control panel.

5. Unplugged power and rebooted.

6. Repeated the flash procedure for dd-wrt.v24_std_generic.bin

7. Sat Jul 30 18:53:17 AKDT 2011 - Clicked update.
Timer dispalyed for 300s...

8. Sat Jul 30 18:54:54 AKDT 2011 - Not 300s, rebooted.

9. Now displays: firmware: DD-WRT v24-sp1 (07/27/08) std


o The default root/admin account worked for login.

o wizzle displays as firmware DD-WRT v23 SP1 Final (05/16/06) std.

o Determined that wizzle (garage), s/n: CL7A0F209509, has ip 192.168.1.1
Changed bornite's eth7 from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.100 to alleviate conflict.
