Tomato is a fine, free (in all senses) alternative, and I personally love the 
Tomato-USB [tomatousb.org] version.
Tomato USB is an alternative Linux-based firmware for powering Broadcom-based 
ethernet routers.  It is a modification of the famous Tomato firmware, with 
additional built-in support for USB port, wireless-N mode support, support for 
several newer router models, and various enhancements.

dd-wrt Switched Ports
This page explains how to configure VLAN's properly by setting the nvram variables to 
configure them because the GUI does not always do so correctly.  As far as I know this 
only applies to Broadcom based hardware.

dd-wrt Multiple WLANs
This guide teaches you how to broadcast multiple WLAN SSID's using virtual interfaces. 
You can have different encryption settings for each WLAN and you can restrict what they 
have access to.  You may also bridge a VLAN or VPN tunnel interface to the virtual 
wireless interface.
